  title: "About Me"
  description: |
    I'm a frontend and creative developer focused on building interfaces that feel expressive, useful, and fast.

    I also work with Figma for design and mockups, and I love open source, creative coding, and the intersection of technology, music, and digital art.

    Currently learning the amazing Godot Engine as an game dev hobbist. (hope to finish something soon)
