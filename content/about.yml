  Hi, I'm **Gilbert Ndresaj**, a **Frontend and Creative Developer** based in Cuneo, Italy.


  I started working with computers when I was around 8 years old, and over time that curiosity turned into a mix of passions: web development, open source, creative coding, game development, digital art, and music.

  I enjoy building projects where design and engineering work together, from polished user interfaces to experimental interactive ideas. I also spend a lot of time in **Figma** creating mockups and visual directions before implementation.

  I also really love **Godot**. I'm actively learning it more deeply to build games and interactive experiences with the same creative mindset I bring to frontend work. Before that, I spent a lot of time with **GameMaker Engine**, and that background still shapes how I think about interaction and game feel.

  ### What I Focus On

  - Frontend architecture with modern JavaScript and TypeScript
  - Vue and Nuxt ecosystem projects
  - UI design and mockups in Figma
  - Godot learning path (with a GameMaker background)
  - Creative development and interaction-driven experiences
  - Open-source collaboration

  ### Beyond Work

  Outside coding, I spend time exploring music, visual experimentation, and digital culture. I like building things that are useful, but also memorable.
