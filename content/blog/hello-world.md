Welcome to my first post.

I'll write about technology, music, art, and whatever else I find interesting.

## Why this blog

I've been playing with computers since I was around 8 years old.
Over the years I built up a wide range of interests: web development, open source, design, game development, creative coding, electronic music, and digital art.

This blog is where I share what I learn while working in tech and what inspires me creatively.

## Stack

This portfolio and blog are built with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/).

I chose this stack because I love working with [Vue](https://vuejs.org), and I care a lot about open-source ecosystems.

## What to expect

Future posts will cover frontend development, experiments, tools, music references, and notes from real projects.

See you in the next post.
